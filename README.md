Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval with Jupyter Notebook, SQLite and SQLAlchemy

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze a dataset pertaining to weather conditions (temperature and precipitation data) for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine ifopening up a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii, a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

In order to explore the data in the SQLite database, we used SQLAlchemy to connect and generate queries to pull the necessary information needed for our analysis. Throughout this module, we used Jupiter notebook to import dependencies and create the commands to pull the data from the SQLite database.
